        <p class="term-heading">Definitions</p>
        <p class="term-detail">
          ‘Non-personal data’ (NPD) is information that is in no way personally identifiable. ‘Personal data’ (PD) means
          any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable
          natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a
          name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the
          physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. PD is
          in many ways the same as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, PD is broader in scope and covers
          more data.<br>

          A “Visitor” is someone who merely browses our website. A “Member” is someone who has registered with us to use
          our services or buy our products. The term “User” is a collective identifier that refers to either a Visitor
          or a Member.

          <i>Google Analytics Privacy notice</i><br>
          Our website uses Google Analytics to collect information about the use of our website. Google Analytics
          collects information from users such as age, gender, interests, demographics, how often they visit our
          website, what pages they visit, and what other websites they have used before coming to our website. We use
          the information we get from Google Analytics to analyze traffic, remarket our products and services to users,
          improve our marketing, advertising, and to improve our website. Google Analytics collects only the IP address
          assigned to you on the date you visit our website, not your name or other identifying information. We do not
          combine the information collected using Google Analytics with PD. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent
          cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our website, the cookie
          cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google also uses specific identifiers to help collect information about

          <i>Google Remarketing</i>
          Why am I seeing ads by Google for products I’ve viewed?
          Our website uses a remarketing advertising service. Our remarketing service is provided by Google and other
          companies that show our ads on websites across the Internet. With remarketing you may see ads for our products
          you have previously looked at. As an example, suppose you visit a website that sells computers, but you do not
          buy a computer on your first visit to that website. The website’s owner might like to encourage you to revisit
          his/her site and buy a computer by showing you his/her ads again on other websites that you visit. We use
          remarketing for similar purposes. For this to happen, Google will read a cookie that is already in your
          browser, or they place a cookie in your browser when you visit our site or other sites using
          remarketing.<br><br>

          You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies and remarketing at this link:<br>

          <i>Facebook Remarketing</i><br>
          Third parties, including Facebook, may use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or
          receive information from our website and elsewhere on the internet, and use that information to provide
          measurement services and target ads. With Facebook remarketing you may see our ads on Facebook after you have
          visited our site. For this to happen, Facebook uses a Custom Audience Pixel that is activated when a visitor
          lands on a webpage and a unique “cookie” is placed in their browser. Facebook lookalike audience targeting
          allows us to show ads on Facebook to people who are similar to those who have already visited our website. To
          opt out of Facebook’s collection and use of information for ad targeting visit:

          security of your PD. We and the third parties who provide services for us, also maintain technical and
          physical safeguards to protect your PD. We strongly urge you to protect any password you may have for our

          You may have to provide a credit card to buy products and services from our website. We use third-party
          billing services and have no control over these services. We use our commercially reasonable efforts to make
          sure your credit card number is kept strictly confidential by using only third-party billing services that use
          industry-standard encryption technology to protect your credit card number from unauthorized use. However, you
          understand and agree that we are in no way responsible for any misuse of your credit card number.

        <p id="14" class="term-heading">Transferring Personal Data from the European Union</p>
        <p class="term-detail">
          Personal data (PD) that we collect from you may be stored, processed, and transferred between any of the
          countries in which we operate, specifically the United States. The European Union has not found the United
          States to have an adequate level of protection of PD under Article 45 of the GDPR. Our company relies on
          derogations for specific situations as defined in Article 49 of the GDPR. For European Union customers and
          users, with your consent, your PD may be transferred outside the European Union to the United States. We will
          use your PD to provide the goods, services, and/or information you request from us to perform a contract with
          you or to satisfy a legitimate interest of our company in a manner that does not outweigh your freedoms and
          rights. Wherever we transfer, process or store your PD, we will take reasonable steps to protect it. We will
          use the information we collect from you in accordance with our privacy notice. By using our website, services,
          or products, you agree to the transfers of your PD described within this section.

          notice, we will post those changes on our website so that our users and customers are always aware of what
          information we collect, use, and disclose. If at any time we decide to disclose or use your PD in a method
          different from that specified at the time it was collected, we will provide advance notice by email (sent to
          the email address on file in your account). Otherwise we will use and disclose our users’ and customers’ PD in
          agreement with the privacy notice in effect when the information was collected. In all cases, your continued
          use of our website, services, and products after any change to this privacy notice will constitute your
          acceptance of such change.
